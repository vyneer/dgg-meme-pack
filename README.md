# D.GG meme resource pack for Minecraft

Not originally made by me, I just updated it to work with 1.16.2+

## Installation

Download repo as zip and unpack into your resourcepack folder (dgg-meme-pack-master should be in the folder).

## Changes

1. Added 2 other Villager outfits: ["nathanTiny2"](https://i.redd.it/xdo7fgb2b9yz.jpg) for Desert, Jungle and Savanna biomes, and ["angry Steve in a grey hoodie"](https://i.imgur.com/jbqZF7h.jpeg) for Snow and Taiga biomes.
2. The existing "blue coat" outfit is now for Plains and Swamp biomes.
3. Farmer Villager has a blue fedora instead of a straw hat.
