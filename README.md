# D.GG meme resource pack for Minecraft

Not originally made by me, I just updated it to work with 1.16.2+

## Installation

Download repo as zip into your resourcepack folder.

## Changes

1. Added 2 other Villager outfits: "nathanTiny2" for Desert, Jungle and Savanna biomes, and "angry Steve in a grey hoodie" for Snow and Taiga biomes.
2. The existing "blue coat" outfit is now for Plains and Swamp biomes.
3. Farmer Villager has a blue fedora instead of a straw hat.
